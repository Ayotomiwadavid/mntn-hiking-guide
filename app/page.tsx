        description="The only thing about beginning hiking is that you don't really need any special gear, you can probably get away with things you already have. Let's start with clothing, a typical mistake hiking beginners make is wearing denim jeans or any heavy pant. Avoid plated jackets and go for a lighter breathable jacket or a flannel shirt you can easily put on or off."

        title="Understand Your Map & Timing"
        description="To start, print out the guide and study the map. Get a sense of the lay of the land. I also like to know what to expect time-wise. Typically on flat terrain, you can hike 3 miles every hour. Adjust, but keep in mind that hiking is not a race, you should always allow time to stop and take in the beautiful scenery that each of your hikes offer."
